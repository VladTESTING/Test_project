I am currently working on a course project, testing the Ringl mobile messenger. During the testing process, a test-plan was developed, then a check-list, test-case (smoke, critical) were written. In the process of passing test-cases, Bug-reports were found and issued. We are currently working on TRR. There are 3 people in the team.
